# GEE-Simple-Tutorial-
This is just practice with GEE. Youtube has detailed tutorials on this.

I'll be showing you just a simple tutorial on what I learnt recently.( Ok by the time you see this, it prolly won't be recent.Lol! )

# 1.Sign up for GEE

# 2.Download Data in this Directory ( University_locations.csv )
Do this while waiting for the authentication emails to come through

# 3.As the data uploads, explore the GEE dashboard.
You can check out the data sets on here.

For today, we'll be using the ERA5 dataset under Climate.

# 4.Once the data has been uploaded, you can explore university locations on the map using this code.

# 5. Show real world max temperature on the map

# 6.You can change the iputs to math your country by using this file

# 7.Change to 1 year so that it runs faster.

# 8.Use inspector to select a point in your country to zoom in on
